Interest continued to accrue during these periods, making the total debt larger over time and creating a cycle that is difficult to break.\\n\\n3. Poor Account Management and Errors: There were issues with incorrect or inconsistent account information, mismatched balances, and lack of detailed breakdowns of loan or interest calculations. These errors hindered borrowers' ability to understand or manage their repayments effectively.\\n\\n4.

        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",

The main reasons include:\\n\\n1. **Lack of Proper Notification and Communication:** Many borrowers were not adequately informed when their payments were due, when their loans were transferred to different servicers, or when their payment status changed. This lack of notice led to misunderstandings and missed payments.\\n\\n2. **Compounding and Unmanageable Interest:** Borrowers reported that interest continued to accrue and compound, especially during periods of forbearance, making the total debt grow faster than they could repay, even with consistent payments.\\n\\n3. **Limited Payment Options and Misleading Guidance:** Many borrowers were only offered options like forbearance or deferment, which often led to increased interest and extended repayment periods. There was a lack of guidance on income-driven repayment plans or loan forgiveness programs that could make repayments more manageable.\\n\\n4. **Errors and Mismanagement by Servicers:** Complaints include misapplied payments, incorrect balance reporting, unauthorized transfer of loans, and failure to follow federal regulations about notices and collection efforts. These mistakes sometimes resulted in negative credit reports and difficulty in managing repayment.\\n\\n5. **Financial Hardship and Unemployment:** Personal financial hardships, such as unemployment, low income, or unforeseen expenses, played a significant role. Some borrowers were unable to afford increased payments due to economic conditions or misunderstanding of their loan terms.\\n\\n6. **Misleading or Incomplete Information:** Several borrowers received bad or confusing information about their loan status, payment obligations, or eligibility for assistance programs, leading to missed or defaulted payments.\\n\\nOverall, this combination of inadequate communication, complex procedures, mismanagement, and personal financial difficulties contributed to many people's failure to pay back their loans.\""
