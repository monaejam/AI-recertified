            "Response: The 'Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem' refers to the tendency of CEOs or startup founders to hire executives who are weak in the areas that were their own specialties. This phenomenon occurs when a CEO, who previously excelled in a specific function (like being a product manager, salesperson, or marketer), selects someone underqualified for that same executive role, allowing the CEO to retain control and prominence in that function. The context explains this issue using the example of Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who, despite his successful background in television, struggled when he oversaw ABC, letting it fall to fourth place. Eisner's comment, wishing he could personally turn the network around if he had more time, highlights the disconnect between his abilities and the effectiveness of his hire in that area (Source 1).\n",
